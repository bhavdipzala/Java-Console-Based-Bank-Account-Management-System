## 💼 Bank Account Management System

A **console-based Java application** that simulates core banking operations. Users can create accounts, deposit or withdraw funds, check balances, and view account details—all securely protected by password authentication. The system also tracks and displays a detailed transaction history for each account.

### 🔒 Security Notes

* All sensitive actions (withdrawal, balance check, detail view, transaction history) are **password-protected**.
* Passwords are stored in plaintext for simplicity, but in a real-world system, passwords should be securely hashed and encrypted.

---

### 📌 Possible Future Improvements

* Encrypt password storage
* Add interest calculation
* Export transaction logs to file
* GUI or Web UI with JavaFX or Spring Boot
* Integration with database (e.g., MySQL or SQLite)
